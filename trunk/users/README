# Subversion $Id$

The /user directory branch contains one subdir for each member of the project.
Feel free to create new ones as needed, but only make changes in your area.

User directories can be used for developing ideas and then moving them into
the appropriate destination eg.

          svn move my_cool_idea.pro ../../skymap/idl/cool_idea.pro
