= Introduction =
Starting in May 2012 we will have 16 weeks to focus on improvements to the SkyMap tools and application to scientific questions.  

Software related tasks include
 * converting "old" IDL code into a unified object oriented framework while still maintaining computational efficiency
 * improving coverage of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing unit tests] to ensure valid results
 * documenting concepts, algorithms, and examples
 * developing a Python based toolkit

Scientific applications include
 * mapping very high resolution auroral all-sky images from the AuroraMax SLR
 * validating orientation of the new Norstar merdian scanning photometers
 * estimating cloud cover and viewing conditions
 * spectral calibration using stellar sources
 * automated determination of instrument orientation

is to use stars to carry out

Brian Jackel will supervise John Anglo and Eric Davis, 

 * overview of space physics and the aurora 
 * introduction to computing tools
   * IDL
   * Subversion/Dropbox/Cygwin/LaTex
== Monday April 30 ==
Ensure that two Windows machines are functional, run updates, check NAS status.

== Tuesday May 01 ==
Meet at my office (SB637) around 09:30am so that we can
 * acquire keys for Division 10 (SB6??)
 * get Eric Davis info (SIN etc.) to Jeannette (SB6??) for payroll
 * create Windows accounts
 * create Google accounts for access to [https://code.google.com/p/calgary-skymap calgary-skymap], add to [https://code.google.com/p/calgary-skymap/adminMembers project committers]
 * set up Dropbox or Google Drive for backup
 * initial Subversion pull
start overview of space physics
 * 
start review of IDL
