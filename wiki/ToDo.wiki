#summary Action items and future plans

= License review =
I picked the GPL3 license almost at random.  Someone should google around ie.
 *http://google-opensource.blogspot.ca/2008/05/standing-against-license-proliferation.html
 *http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1082101/which-google-code-license-should-i-use
and see if one of the other options is better
 * Apache License 2.0
 * Artistic License/GPL
 * Eclipse Public License 1.0
 * GNU GPL v2
 * GNU GPL v3
 * GNU lesser GPL
 * MIT License
 * Mozilla Public License 1.1
 * New BSD License

My goal is to make our work freely available to everyone, while not exposing ourselves to any legal jeopardy.  It would be ideal if other researchers would want to contribute to our project.  

= IDL objects =

== myInteger ==
Create the simplest possible IDL object containing a single 16-bit integer.  Write the minimal set of methods: init, set, get, destroy.

== myIntegerWithUnits ==
Use inheritance to create a more complex object.  Add a "units" field (string) and make changes to allow
{{{
  obj->set,6.0,'metres'
  help,obj->get(),/structure
  struct {value:6.0, units:'metres'}
}}}

== skymap_vector ==
Review the code in [http://code.google.com/p/calgary-skymap/source/browse/trunk/skymap/idl/skymap_vector__define.pro skymap_vector__define], focusing on the "selftest" method.

=== Euler angles ===
A generic rotation can be expressed in terms of three Euler angles for three successive rotations about the z,x',z' axes.  This can be collapsed into a single 3x3 matrix eg. Goldstein equation 4-46.  Write IDL code to do rotations with the single matrix and compare to my 3-step implementation.  Is it faster?

Also read Goldstein appendix B and google "gimbal lock".  Discuss...

=== rotation ===
Take a look at the "rotation" method and read my [http://code.google.com/p/calgary-skymap/source/browse/trunk/users/Brian.Jackel/tex/notes.pdf notes].  Check my derivation, then test simple cases of rotations about x/y/z axes.  Then code up the general 3x3 matrix and compare it to my approach.  Is it faster?


= Stellar calibration =
An ideal optical system would allow us to determine exactly
 * when each photon arrived
 * how much energy it had (wavelength)
 * the incident vector direction (orientation)

In practice the measurements will be incomplete.  Not every photon will produce a count, with sensitivity that may depend on wavelength and direction.  Using a calibration source of known intensity we can determine the instrument response (transfer function).
