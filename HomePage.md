# Introduction #
Geometric and photometric calibration of auroral all-sky imagers and meridian scanning photometers is essential
for quantitative scientific applications.  However, dark-room characterization requires that instruments be
removed from remote field sites, shipped to a central facility, then returned to the field.  This process can be
expensive, time-consuming, and carries an added risk of damage to sensitive optics or electronics.  As well,
shipping and re-deployment may cause significant changes to the instrument response, possibly invalidating the
painstaking exercise.  Even an aggressive annual schedule cannot track slow instrument drift, identify sub-optimal
viewing conditions (e. ice on the dome), or determine the precise time of sudden changes in system response.

Modern instrumentation is typically sensitive to intensities in the 1-100 Rayleighs range at time-scales
of a few seconds.  This is sufficient to detect "sub-visual" aurora and more than adequate for hundreds or
thousands of stars.  It should be noted that auroral instruments

Starting May 2012 we will have 16 weeks to develop an integrated toolkit for stellar calibration of auroral
devices, and to use it for several important applications
  * mapping very high resolution auroral all-sky images from the AuroraMax SLR
  * validating orientation of the new Norstar merdian scanning photometers
  * estimating cloud cover and viewing conditions
  * spectral calibration using stellar sources
  * automatic determination of instrument orientation

is to use stars to carry out

# History #
The earliest ancestor of this project was created at the University of Western Ontario to analyze data from intersecting beams of the EISCAT tristatic radar system.  It was subsequently extended to work with the MIDAS-C bistatic radar system.

The THEMIS all-sky imager array provided the impetus for further development, including skymap "savefiles" used to generate CDF files.

Then Rainbow.

Now hi-res and MSP.
